The bread bag and basket liners are really high quality and the bread bag design is SO cute! Attention to detail makes this a fantastic product! We would definitely buy again!`,
    `We really wanted to find a set of medium size bannetons that would work for most Artisan recipes! Unfortunately, we found that most sellers like to include a large 10 inch round banneton with a much smaller oval (maybe because the oval fits inside the round and makes shipping cheaper?)... until we found this set- the round and oval are perfect for making those medium size loaves that most recipes call for! And what a BEAUTIFUL set- bannetons are really nice and smooth! You can really tell that these are hand-woven! The entire package is charming! And the bread bag... we LOVE it!`,
    `We're extremely impressed with this banneton set! From the cute design on the bread bag, to the graphic on the dough scraper handle, to how nice and smooth the bannetons are- this is a really fantastic set! I finally have a scoring lame like all of the videos and recipes call for- Food Network, here we come!  We love this proofing basket set and would definitely buy again!`,
